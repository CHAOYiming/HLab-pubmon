    abstract = "{In recent years, the well-known Infinite Sites Assumption (ISA) has been a fundamental feature of computational methods devised for reconstructing tumor phylogenies and inferring cancer progressions. However, recent studies leveraging Single-Cell Sequencing (SCS) techniques have shown evidence of the widespread recurrence and, especially, loss of mutations in several tumor samples. While there exist established computational methods that infer phylogenies with mutation losses, there remain some advancements to be made.We present SASC (Simulated Annealing Single-Cell inference): a new and robust approach based on simulated annealing for the inference of cancer progression from SCS data sets. In particular, we introduce an extension of the model of evolution where mutations are only accumulated, by allowing also a limited amount of mutation loss in the evolutionary history of the tumor: the Dollo-k model. We demonstrate that SASC achieves high levels of accuracy when tested on both simulated and real data sets and in comparison with some other available methods.The Simulated Annealing Single-Cell inference (SASC) tool is open source and available at https://github.com/sciccolella/sasc.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

	abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is developing rapidly, and investigators seeking to use this technology are left with a variety of options for both experimental platform and bioinformatics methods. There is an urgent need for scRNA-seq reference datasets for benchmarking of different scRNA-seq platforms and bioinformatics methods. To be broadly applicable, these should be generated from renewable, well characterized reference samples and processed in multiple centers across different platforms. Here we present a benchmarking scRNA-seq dataset that includes 20 scRNA-seq datasets acquired either as a mixtures or as individual samples from two biologically distinct cell lines for which a large amount of multi-platform whole genome sequencing data are also available. These scRNA-seq datasets were generated from multiple popular platforms across four sequencing centers. Our benchmark datasets provide a resource that we believe will have great value for the single-cell community by serving as a reference dataset for evaluating various bioinformatics methods for scRNA-seq analyses, including but not limited to data preprocessing, imputation, normalization, clustering, batch correction, and differential analysis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {It is a major challenge to integrate single-cell sequencing data across experiments, conditions, batches, time points, and other technical considerations. New computational methods are required that can integrate samples while simultaneously preserving biological information. Here, we propose an unsupervised reference-free data representation, cluster similarity spectrum (CSS), where each cell is represented by its similarities to clusters independently identified across samples. We show that CSS can be used to assess cellular heterogeneity and enable reconstruction of differentiation trajectories from cerebral organoid and other single-cell transcriptomic data, and to integrate data across experimental conditions and human individuals.},

	abstract = {Anti-CD20{\textendash}mediated B cell depletion is a highly effective therapy in MS. However, long-term effects of this approach on the immune system are not yet characterized in detail. After cessation of anti-CD20 treatment, B cells reappear immature yet highly activated. In addition, anti-CD20 treatment exerts long-lasting effects on T cells, which may be important for its clinical effect. These findings may help in guiding therapeutic decisions with regard to treatment intervals and follow-up therapies.B cell depletion via anti-CD20 antibodies is a highly effective treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS). However, little is known about the maturation/activation stage of the returning B cell population after treatment cessation and the wider effects on other immune cells. In the present study, 15 relapsing-remitting MS patients receiving 1,000 mg of rituximab were included. B, T, and myeloid cells were analyzed before anti-CD20 administration and in different time intervals thereafter over a period of 24 mo. In comparison to the phenotype before anti-CD20 treatment, the reappearing B cell pool revealed a less mature and more activated phenotype: 1) reappearing B cells were significantly enriched in transitional (before: 10.1 {\textpm} 1.9\%, after: 58.8 {\textpm} 5.2\%) and mature naive phenotypes (before: 45.5 {\textpm} 3.1\%, after: 25.1 {\textpm} 3.5\%); 2) the frequency of memory B cells was reduced (before: 36.7 {\textpm} 3.1\%, after: 8.9 {\textpm} 1.7\%); and 3) reappearing B cells showed an enhanced expression of activation markers CD25 (before: 2.1 {\textpm} 0.4\%, after: 9.3 {\textpm} 2.1\%) and CD69 (before: 5.9 {\textpm} 1.0\%, after: 21.4 {\textpm} 3.0\%), and expressed significantly higher levels of costimulatory CD40 and CD86. T cells showed 1) a persistent increase in naive (CD4+: before: 11.8 {\textpm} 1.3\%, after: 18.4 {\textpm} 3.4\%; CD8+: before: 12.5 {\textpm} 1.4\%, after: 16.5 {\textpm} 2.3\%) and 2) a decrease in terminally differentiated subsets (CD4+: before: 47.3 {\textpm} 3.2\%, after: 34.4 {\textpm} 3.7\%; CD8+: before: 53.7 {\textpm} 2.1\%, after: 49.1 {\textpm} 2.7\%).All study data are included in the article and SI Appendix.},

abstract = {Abstract Background During the last decade, the analysis of ancient DNA (aDNA) sequence has become a powerful tool for the study of past human populations. However, the degraded nature of aDNA means that aDNA molecules are short and frequently mutated by post-mortem chemical modifications. These features decrease read mapping accuracy and increase reference bias, in which reads containing non-reference alleles are less likely to be mapped than those containing reference alleles. Alternative approaches have been developed to replace the linear reference with a variation graph which includes known alternative variants at each genetic locus. Here, we evaluate the use of variation graph software to avoid reference bias for aDNA and compare with existing methods. Results We use to align simulated and real aDNA samples to a variation graph containing 1000 Genome Project variants and compare with the same data aligned with to the human linear reference genome. Using leads to a balanced allelic representation at polymorphic sites, effectively removing reference bias, and more sensitive variant detection in comparison with , especially for insertions and deletions (indels). Alternative approaches that use relaxed parameter settings or filter alignments can also reduce bias but can have lower sensitivity than , particularly for indels. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that aligning aDNA sequences to variation graphs effectively mitigates the impact of reference bias when analyzing aDNA, while retaining mapping sensitivity and allowing detection of variation, in particular indel variation, that was previously missed.},
