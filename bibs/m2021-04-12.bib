	abstract = {Every human inherits one copy of the genome from their mother and another from their father. Parental inheritance helps us understand the transmission of traits and genetic diseases, which often involve de novo variants and rare recessive alleles. Here we present DeepTrio, which learns to analyze child-mother-father trios from the joint sequence information, without explicit encoding of inheritance priors. DeepTrio learns how to weigh sequencing error, mapping error, and de novo rates and genome context directly from the sequence data. DeepTrio has higher accuracy on both Illumina and PacBio HiFi data when compared to DeepVariant. Improvements are especially pronounced at lower coverages (with 20x DeepTrio roughly equivalent to 30x DeepVariant). As DeepTrio learns directly from data, we also demonstrate extensions to exome calling solely by changing the training data. DeepTrio includes pre-trained models for Illumina WGS, Illumina exome, and PacBio HiFi.Competing Interest StatementAll authors are employees of Google LLC and own Alphabet stock as part of the standard compensation package.

Here we present SMaSH, a general computational framework for extracting key marker genes from single-cell RNA sequencing data for spatial transcriptomics approaches. SMaSH extracts robust and biologically well-motivated marker genes, which characterise the given data-set better than existing and limited computational approaches for global marker gene calculation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Pangenomics is emerging as a powerful computational paradigm in bioinformatics. This field uses population-level genome reference structures, typically consisting of a sequence graph, to mitigate reference bias and facilitate analyses that were challenging with previous reference-based methods. In this work, we extend these methods into transcriptomics to analyze sequencing data using the pantranscriptome: a population-level transcriptomic reference. Our novel toolchain can construct spliced pangenome graphs, map RNA-seq data to these graphs, and perform haplotype-aware expression quantification of transcripts in a pantranscriptome. This workflow improves accuracy over state-of-the-art RNA-seq mapping methods, and it can efficiently quantify haplotype-specific transcript expression without needing to characterize a sample{\textquoteright}s haplotypes beforehand.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
