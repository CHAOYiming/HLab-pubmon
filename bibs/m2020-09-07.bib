  abstract={
    It is a major challenge to integrate single-cell sequencing data 
    across experiments, conditions, batches, time points, and other technical 
    considerations. New computational methods are required that can integrate 
    samples while simultaneously preserving biological information. Here, we 
    propose an unsupervised reference-free data representation, cluster 
    similarity spectrum (CSS), where each cell is represented by its 
    similarities to clusters independently identified across samples. We show 
    that CSS can be used to assess cellular heterogeneity and enable 
    reconstruction of differentiation trajectories from cerebral organoid and 
    other single-cell transcriptomic data, and to integrate data across 
    experimental conditions and human individuals.
