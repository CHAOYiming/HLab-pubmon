	abstract = {Single cell RNA-sequencing has revolutionized transcriptome analysis. ScRNA-seq provides a massive resource for studying biological phenomena at single cell level. One of the most important applications of scRNA-seq is the inference of dynamic cell states through modeling of transcriptional dynamics. Understanding the full transcriptional dynamics using the concept named RNA Velocity enables us to identify cell states, regimes of regulatory changes in cell states, and putative drivers within these states. We present scRegulocity that integrates RNA-velocity estimates with locality information from cell embedding coordinates. scRegulocity focuses on velocity switching patterns, local patterns where velocity of nearby cells change abruptly. These different transcriptional dynamics patterns can be indicative of transitioning cell states. scRegulocity annotates these patterns with genes and enriched pathways and also analyzes and visualizes the velocity switching patterns at the regulatory network level. scRegulocity also combines velocity estimation, pattern detection and visualization steps.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = 	 { Much work has been done recently to make neural networks more interpretable, and one approach is to arrange for the network to use only a subset of the available features. In linear models, Lasso (or $\ell_1$-regularized) regression assigns zero weights to the most irrelevant or redundant features, and is widely used in data science. However the Lasso only applies to linear models. Here we introduce LassoNet, a neural network framework with global feature selection. Our approach achieves feature sparsity by allowing a feature to participate in a hidden unit only if its linear representative is active. Unlike other approaches to feature selection for neural nets, our method uses a modified objective function with constraints, and so integrates feature selection with the parameter learning directly. As a result, it delivers an entire regularization path of solutions with a range of feature sparsity. In experiments with real and simulated data, LassoNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for feature selection and regression. The LassoNet method uses projected proximal gradient descent, and generalizes directly to deep networks. It can be implemented by adding just a few lines of code to a standard neural network. }

  abstract = 	 { The manifold hypothesis states that high-dimensional data can be modeled as lying on or near a low-dimensional, nonlinear manifold. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) approximate this manifold by learning mappings from low-dimensional latent vectors to high-dimensional data while encouraging a global structure in the latent space through the use of a specified prior distribution. When this prior does not match the structure of the true data manifold, it can lead to a less accurate model of the data. To resolve this mismatch, we introduce the Variational Autoencoder with Learned Latent Structure (VAELLS) which incorporates a learnable manifold model into the latent space of a VAE. This enables us to learn the nonlinear manifold structure from the data and use that structure to define a prior in the latent space. The integration of a latent manifold model not only ensures that our prior is well-matched to the data, but also allows us to define generative transformation paths in the latent space and describe class manifolds with transformations stemming from examples of each class. We validate our model on examples with known latent structure and also demonstrate its capabilities on a real-world dataset. }

	abstract = {Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is an intuitively appealing method to extract additive combinations of measurements from noisy or complex data. NMF is applied broadly to text and image processing, time-series analysis, and genomics, where recent technological advances permit sequencing experiments to measure the representation of tens of thousands of features in millions of single cells. In these experiments, a count of zero for a given feature in a given cell may indicate either the absence of that feature or an insufficient read coverage to detect that feature ({\textquotedblleft}dropout{\textquotedblright}). In contrast to spectral decompositions such as the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), the strictly positive imputation of signal by NMF is an ideal fit for single-cell data with ambiguous zeroes. Nevertheless, most single-cell analysis pipelines apply SVD or Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on transformed counts because these implementations are fast while current NMF implementations are slow. To address this need, we present an accessible NMF implementation that is much faster than PCA and rivals the runtimes of state-of-the-art SVD. NMF models learned with our implementation from raw count matrices yield intuitive summaries of complex biological processes, capturing coordinated gene activity and enrichment of sample metadata. Our NMF implementation, available in the RcppML (Rcpp Machine Learning library) R package, improves upon current NMF implementations by introducing a scaling diagonal to enable convex L1 regularization for feature engineering, reproducible factor scalings, and symmetric factorizations. RcppML NMF easily handles sparse datasets with millions of samples, making NMF an attractive replacement for PCA in the analysis of single-cell experiments.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
