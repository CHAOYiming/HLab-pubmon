    abstract = "{microRNAs (miRNAs) are important gene regulators and they are involved in many biological processes, including cancer progression. Therefore, correctly identifying miRNA-mRNA interactions is a crucial task. To this end, a huge number of computational methods has been developed, but they mainly use the data at one snapshot and ignore the dynamics of a biological process. The recent development of single cell data and the booming of the exploration of cell trajectories using “pseudo-time” concept have inspired us to develop a pseudo-time based method to infer the miRNA-mRNA relationships characterising a biological process by taking into account the temporal aspect of the process.We have developed a novel approach, called pseudo-time causality (PTC), to find the causal relationships between miRNAs and mRNAs during a biological process. We have applied the proposed method to both single cell and bulk sequencing datasets for Epithelia to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), a key process in cancer metastasis. The evaluation results show that our method significantly outperforms existing methods in finding miRNA-mRNA interactions in both single cell and bulk data. The results suggest that utilising the pseudo-temporal information from the data helps reveal the gene regulation in a biological process much better than using the static information.R scripts and datasets can be found at https://github.com/AndresMCB/PTCthuc.le@unisa.edu.auSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

    year = {2020},

    abstract = "{Nearly 40\\% of the genes in sequenced genomes have no experimentally- or computationally-derived functional annotations. To fill this gap, we seek to develop methods for network-based gene function prediction that can integrate heterogeneous data for multiple species with experimentally-based functional annotations and systematically transfer them to newly-sequenced organisms on a genomewide scale. However, the large sizes of such networks pose a challenge for the scalability of current methods.We develop a label propagation algorithm called FastSinkSource. By formally bounding its rate of progress, we decrease the running time by a factor of 100 without sacrificing accuracy. We systematically evaluate many approaches to construct multi-species bacterial networks and apply FastSinkSource and other state-of-the-art methods to these networks. We find that the most accurate and efficient approach is to pre-compute annotation scores for species with experimental annotations, and then to transfer them to other organisms. In this manner, FastSinkSource runs in under three minutes for 200 bacterial species.An implementation of our framework and all data used in this research are available at https://github.com/Murali-group/multi-species-GOA-prediction.murali@cs.vt.eduSupplementary information is available at Bioinformatics online.}",
