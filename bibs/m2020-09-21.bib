    abstract = "{At present, a fundamental challenge in single-cell RNA-sequencing data analysis is functional interpretation and annotation of cell clusters. Biological pathways in distinct cell types have different activation patterns, which facilitates the understanding of cell functions using single-cell transcriptomics. However, no effective web tool has been implemented for single-cell transcriptome data analysis based on prior biological pathway knowledge.Here, we present scTPA, a web-based platform for pathway-based analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data in human and mouse. scTPA incorporates four widely-used gene set enrichment methods to estimate the pathway activation scores of single cells based on a collection of available biological pathways with different functional and taxonomic classifications. The clustering analysis and cell-type-specific activation pathway identification were provided for the functional interpretation of cell types from a pathway-oriented perspective. An intuitive interface allows users to conveniently visualize and download single-cell pathway signatures. Overall, scTPA is a comprehensive tool for the identification of pathway activation signatures for the analysis of single cell heterogeneity.http://sctpa.bio-data.cn/sctpa.sujz@wmu.edu.cn or yufulong421@gmail.com or zgj@zjut.edu.cnSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

abstract = {Background Colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) is one of the common gastrointestinal malignant diseases, with high mortality rate and poor prognosis due to delayed diagnosis. This study aimed to construct a prognostic prediction model for patients with colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) recurrence. Methods Differently expressed RNAs (DERs) between recurrence and non-recurrence COAD samples were identified based on expression profile data from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Then, recurrent COAD discriminating classifier was established using SMV-RFE algorithm, and receiver operating characteristic curve was used to assess the predictive power of classifier. Furthermore, the prognostic prediction model was constructed based on univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis, and Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis was used to estimate this model. Furthermore, the co-expression network of DElncRNAs and DEmRNAs was constructed followed by GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. Results A total of 54 optimized signature DElncRNAs were screened and SMV classifier was constructed, which presented a high accuracy to distinguish recurrence and non-recurrence COAD samples. Furthermore, six independent prognostic lncRNAs signatures (LINC00852, ZNF667-AS1, FOXP1-IT1, LINC01560, TAF1A-AS1, and LINC00174) in COAD patients with recurrence were screened, and the prognostic prediction model for recurrent COAD was constructed, which possessed a relative satisfying predicted ability both in the training dataset and validation dataset. Furthermore, the DEmRNAs in the co-expression network were mainly enriched in glycan biosynthesis, cardiac muscle contraction, and colorectal cancer. Conclusions Our study revealed that six lncRNA signatures acted as an independent prognostic biomarker for patients with COAD recurrence.},

abstract = {Epstein–Barr Virus (EBV) infection appears to be necessary for the development of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), although the specific mechanisms are unknown. More than 200 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are known to be associated with the risk of developing MS. About a quarter of these are also highly associated with proximal gene expression in B cells infected with EBV (lymphoblastoid cell lines—LCLs). The DNA of LCLs is hypomethylated compared with both uninfected and activated B cells. Since methylation can affect gene expression, and so cell differentiation and immune evasion, we hypothesised that EBV-driven hypomethylation may affect the interaction between EBV infection and MS. We interrogated an existing dataset comprising three individuals with whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data from EBV transformed B cells and CD40L-activated B cells. DNA methylation surrounding MS risk SNPs associated with gene expression in LCLs (LCLeQTL) was less likely to be hypomethylated than randomly selected chromosomal regions. Differential methylation was independent of genomic features such as promoter regions, but genes preferentially expressed in EBV-infected B cells, including the LCLeQTL genes, were underrepresented in the hypomethylated regions. Our data does not indicate MS genetic risk is affected by EBV hypomethylation.},

    abstract = {Author summary Rational vaccine design efforts depend on accurate inference of full evolutionary paths from a given naive sequence to the corresponding mature B cell receptor sequences in a germinal center. Before one can perform ancestral sequence inference for clonal sequences that result from the same naive rearrangement event, one must first obtain an estimate of the clonal phylogenetic tree. Currently, standard phylogenetic inference techniques are used to model the process of sequence evolution along the tree; however, these methods do not account for all the complexities associated with this evolutionary process. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach to phylogenetic inference for clonal sequences that is based on a phylogenetic hidden Markov model. Our phylo-HMM models both the naive rearrangement and somatic hypermutation processes and this Bayesian framework allows us to naturally account for uncertainty in all unobserved variables, including a phylogenetic tree, via posterior distribution sampling. We perform simulation-based experiments to show that naive sequence and phylogenetic inference performed jointly provides higher-quality estimates than those obtained by considering these inferences separately. Our application to real data reveals significant uncertainty in naive and ancestral sequences, confirming the importance of a Bayesian approach.},

The ability to realistically simulate sequence evolution is also at the core of many benchmarking strategies. Yet, mutational processes have complex context dependencies that remain poorly modeled and understood.We introduce EvoLSTM, a recurrent neural network-based evolution simulator that captures mutational context dependencies. EvoLSTM uses a sequence-to-sequence long short-term memory model trained to predict mutation probabilities at each position of a given sequence, taking into consideration the 14 flanking nucleotides. EvoLSTM can realistically simulate mammalian and plant DNA sequence evolution and reveals unexpectedly strong long-range context dependencies in mutation probabilities. EvoLSTM brings modern machine-learning approaches to bear on sequence evolution. It will serve as a useful tool to study and simulate complex mutational processes.Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/DongjoonLim/EvoLSTM.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",
