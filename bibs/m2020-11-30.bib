abstract = "Transcriptomics, which encompasses assessments of alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation, identification of fusion transcripts, explorations of noncoding RNAs, transcript annotation, and discovery of novel transcripts, is a valuable tool for understanding cancer mechanisms and identifying biomarkers. Recent advances in high-throughput technologies have enabled large-scale gene expression profiling. Importantly, RNA expression profiling of tumor tissue has been successfully used to determine clinically actionable molecular alterations. The WINTHER precision medicine clinical trial was the first prospective trial in diverse solid malignancies that assessed both genomics and transcriptomics to match treatments to specific molecular alterations. The use of transcriptome analysis in WINTHER and other trials increased the number of targetable -omic changes compared to genomic profiling alone. Other applications of transcriptomics involve the evaluation of tumor and circulating noncoding RNAs as predictive and prognostic biomarkers, the improvement of risk stratification by the use of prognostic and predictive multigene assays, the identification of fusion transcripts that drive tumors, and an improved understanding of the impact of DNA changes as some genomic alterations are silenced at the RNA level. Finally, RNA sequencing and gene expression analysis have been incorporated into clinical trials to identify markers predicting response to immunotherapy. Many issues regarding the complexity of the analysis, its reproducibility and variability, and the interpretation of the results still need to be addressed. The integration of transcriptomics with genomics, proteomics, epigenetics, and tumor immune profiling will improve biomarker discovery and our understanding of disease mechanisms and, thereby, accelerate the implementation of precision oncology."

	abstract = {Adult neural stem cells (NSC) are closely related to multiple neurological disorders and brain tumors. Comprehensive investigation of their composition, lineage, and aging will provide insights that may lead to enhanced patient treatment. This study applies a transgene to label and manipulate neural stem/progenitor cells and monitor their evolution during aging. Together with high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing, we are able to analyze the subventricular zone cells from infancy to advanced age with unprecedented granularity. Diverse cell states are identified in the stem-cell niche, and an aging-related NSC deficiency in transition from quiescence to proliferation is identified. The related biological features provide rich resources to inspect adult NSC maintenance and neurogenesis.Adult neural stem cells (NSC) serve as a reservoir for brain plasticity and origin for certain gliomas. Lineage tracing and genomic approaches have portrayed complex underlying heterogeneity within the major anatomical location for NSC, the subventricular zone (SVZ). To gain a comprehensive profile of NSC heterogeneity, we utilized a well-validated stem/progenitor-specific reporter transgene in concert with single-cell RNA sequencing to achieve unbiased analysis of SVZ cells from infancy to advanced age. The magnitude and high specificity of the resulting transcriptional datasets allow precise identification of the varied cell types embedded in the SVZ including specialized parenchymal cells (neurons, glia, microglia) and noncentral nervous system cells (endothelial, immune). Initial mining of the data delineates four quiescent NSC and three progenitor-cell subpopulations formed in a linear progression. Further evidence indicates that distinct stem and progenitor populations reside in different regions of the SVZ. As stem/progenitor populations progress from neonatal to advanced age, they acquire a deficiency in transition from quiescence to proliferation. Further data mining identifies stage-specific biological processes, transcription factor networks, and cell-surface markers for investigation of cellular identities, lineage relationships, and key regulatory pathways in adult NSC maintenance and neurogenesis.Single-cell sequence data have been deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (accession no. GSE107220). All study data are included in the article and supporting information. Data analyzed in Fig. 4C were published in Llorens-Bobadilla et al.

In particular, we generate somatic and germline training models, which include genomic, epigenomic, and conservation-based features, for SV call sets in diseased and healthy individuals. We then apply SVFX to SVs in cancer and other diseases; SVFX achieves high accuracy in identifying pathogenic SVs.

A key challenge in the estimation of single-cell potency is the need for a fast and accurate algorithm, scalable to large scRNA-Seq studies profiling millions of cells.Here we present a single-cell potency measure, called CCAT (Correlation of Connectome and Transcriptome), which can return accurate single-cell potency estimates of a million cells in minutes, a 100 fold improvement over current state-of-the-art methods. We benchmark CCAT against 8 other single-cell potency models and across 28 scRNA-Seq studies, encompassing over 2 million cells, demonstrating comparable accuracy than the current state-of-the-art, at a significantly reduced computational cost, and with increased robustness to dropouts.CCAT is part of the SCENT R-package, freely available from https://github.com/aet21/SCENT}",

abstract={Understanding cellular heterogeneity is the holy grail of biology and medicine. Cells harboring identical genomes show a wide variety of behaviors in multicellular organisms. Genetic circuits underlying cell-type identities will facilitate the understanding of the regulatory programs for differentiation and maintenance of distinct cellular states. Such a cell-type-specific gene network can be inferred from coregulatory patterns across individual cells. Conventional methods of transcriptome profiling using tissue samples provide only average signals of diverse cell types. Therefore, reconstructing gene regulatory networks for a particular cell type is not feasible with tissue-based transcriptome data. Recently, single-cell omics technology has emerged and enabled the capture of the transcriptomic landscape of every individual cell. Although single-cell gene expression studies have already opened up new avenues, network biology using single-cell transcriptome data will further accelerate our understanding of cellular heterogeneity. In this review, we provide an overview of single-cell network biology and summarize recent progress in method development for network inference from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Then, we describe how cell-type-specific gene networks can be utilized to study regulatory programs specific to disease-associated cell types and cellular states. Moreover, with scRNA data, modeling personal or patient-specific gene networks is feasible. Therefore, we also introduce potential applications of single-cell network biology for precision medicine. We envision a rapid paradigm shift toward single-cell network analysis for systems biology in the near future.},
