	abstract = {Genome instability and aberrant alterations of transcriptional programs both play important roles in cancer. However, their relationship and relative contribution to tumor evolution and therapy resistance are not well-understood. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has the potential to investigate both genetic and non-genetic sources of tumor heterogeneity in a single assay. Here we present a computational method, Numbat, that integrates haplotype information obtained from population-based phasing with allele and expression signals to enhance detection of CNVs from scRNA-seq data. To resolve tumor clonal architecture, Numbat exploits the evolutionary relationships between subclones to iteratively infer the single-cell copy number profiles and tumor clonal phylogeny. Analyzing 21 tumor samples composed of multiple myeloma, breast, and thyroid cancers, we show that Numbat can accurately reconstruct the tumor copy number profile and precisely identify malignant cells in the tumor microenvironment. We uncover additional subclonal complexity contributed by allele-specific alterations, and identify genetic subpopulations with transcriptional signatures relevant to tumor progression and therapy resistance. We hope that the increased power to characterize genomic aberrations and tumor subclonal phylogenies provided by Numbat will help delineate contributions of genetic and non-genetic mechanisms in cancer.Competing Interest StatementP.V.K. serves on the Scientific Advisory Board to Celsius Therapeutics Inc. and Biomage Inc.

	abstract = {Cancer genomes exhibit extensive chromosomal copy number changes and structural variation, yet how allele specific alterations drive cancer genome evolution remains unclear. Here, through application of a new computational approach we report allele specific copy number alterations in 11,097 single cell whole genomes from genetically engineered mammary epithelial cells and 21,852 cells from high grade serous ovarian and triple negative breast cancers. Resolving single cell copy number profiles to individual alleles uncovered genomic background distributions of gains, losses and loss of heterozygosity, yielding evidence of positive selection of specific chromosomal alterations. In addition specific genomic loci in maternal and paternal alleles were commonly found to be altered in parallel with convergent phenotypic transcriptional effects. Finally we show that haplotype specific alterations trace the cyclical etiology of high level amplifications and reveal clonal haplotype decomposition of complex structures. Together, our results illuminate how allele and haplotype specific alterations, here determined across thousands of single cell cancer genomes, impact the etiology and evolution of structural variations in human tumours.Competing Interest StatementSPS and SA are shareholders and consultants of Canexia Health Inc.},
