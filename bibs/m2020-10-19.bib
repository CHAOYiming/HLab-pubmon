    abstract = "{microRNAs (miRNAs) are important gene regulators and they are involved in many biological processes, including cancer progression. Therefore, correctly identifying miRNA-mRNA interactions is a crucial task. To this end, a huge number of computational methods has been developed, but they mainly use the data at one snapshot and ignore the dynamics of a biological process. The recent development of single cell data and the booming of the exploration of cell trajectories using “pseudo-time” concept have inspired us to develop a pseudo-time based method to infer the miRNA-mRNA relationships characterising a biological process by taking into account the temporal aspect of the process.We have developed a novel approach, called pseudo-time causality (PTC), to find the causal relationships between miRNAs and mRNAs during a biological process. We have applied the proposed method to both single cell and bulk sequencing datasets for Epithelia to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), a key process in cancer metastasis. The evaluation results show that our method significantly outperforms existing methods in finding miRNA-mRNA interactions in both single cell and bulk data. The results suggest that utilising the pseudo-temporal information from the data helps reveal the gene regulation in a biological process much better than using the static information.R scripts and datasets can be found at https://github.com/AndresMCB/PTCthuc.le@unisa.edu.auSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

    abstract = "{Nearly 40\\% of the genes in sequenced genomes have no experimentally- or computationally-derived functional annotations. To fill this gap, we seek to develop methods for network-based gene function prediction that can integrate heterogeneous data for multiple species with experimentally-based functional annotations and systematically transfer them to newly-sequenced organisms on a genomewide scale. However, the large sizes of such networks pose a challenge for the scalability of current methods.We develop a label propagation algorithm called FastSinkSource. By formally bounding its rate of progress, we decrease the running time by a factor of 100 without sacrificing accuracy. We systematically evaluate many approaches to construct multi-species bacterial networks and apply FastSinkSource and other state-of-the-art methods to these networks. We find that the most accurate and efficient approach is to pre-compute annotation scores for species with experimental annotations, and then to transfer them to other organisms. In this manner, FastSinkSource runs in under three minutes for 200 bacterial species.An implementation of our framework and all data used in this research are available at https://github.com/Murali-group/multi-species-GOA-prediction.murali@cs.vt.eduSupplementary information is available at Bioinformatics online.}",

    abstract = "{Somatic mutations in driver genes may ultimately lead to the development of cancer. Understanding how somatic mutations accumulate in cancer genomes and the underlying factors that generate somatic mutations is therefore crucial for developing novel therapeutic strategies. To understand the interplay between spatial genome organization and specific mutational processes, we studied 3,000 tumor–normal-pair whole-genome datasets from 42 different human cancer types. Our analyses reveal that the change in somatic mutational load in cancer genomes is co-localized with topologically-associating-domain boundaries. Domain boundaries constitute a better proxy to track mutational load change than replication timing measurements. We show that different mutational processes lead to distinct somatic mutation distributions where certain processes generate mutations in active domains, and others generate mutations in inactive domains. Overall, the interplay between three-dimensional genome organization and active mutational processes has a substantial influence on the large-scale mutation-rate variations observed in human cancers.}",

    abstract = "{Drug target interaction (DTI) prediction is a foundational task for in-silico drug discovery, which is costly and time-consuming due to the need of experimental search over large drug compound space. Recent years have witnessed promising progress for deep learning in DTI predictions. However, the following challenges are still open: (1) existing molecular representation learning approaches ignore the sub-structural nature of DTI, thus produce results that are less accurate and difficult to explain; (2) existing methods focus on limited labeled data while ignoring the value of massive unlabelled molecular data.We propose a Molecular Interaction Transformer (MolTrans) to address these limitations via: (1) knowledge inspired sub-structural pattern mining algorithm and interaction modeling module for more accurate and interpretable DTI prediction; (2) an augmented transformer encoder to better extract and capture the semantic relations among substructures extracted from massive unlabeled biomedical data. We evaluate MolTrans on real world data and show it improved DTI prediction performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines.The model scripts is available at https://github.com/kexinhuang12345/moltrans.jimeng@illinois.eduSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

    abstract = "{The complete characterization of enzymatic activities between molecules remains incomplete, hindering biological engineering and limiting biological discovery. We develop in this work a technique, Enzymatic Link Prediction (ELP), for predicting the likelihood of an enzymatic transformation between two molecules. ELP models enzymatic reactions catalogued in the KEGG database as a graph. ELP is innovative over prior works in using graph embedding to learn molecular representations that capture not only molecular and enzymatic attributes but also graph connectivity.We explore transductive (test nodes included in the training graph) and inductive (test nodes not part of the training graph) learning models. We show that ELP achieves high AUC when learning node embeddings using both graph connectivity and node attributes. Further, we show that graph embedding improves link prediction by 30\\% in AUC over fingerprint-based similarity approaches and by 8\\% over Support Vector Machines. We compare ELP against rule-based methods. We also evaluate ELP for predicting links in pathway maps and for reconstruction of edges in reaction networks of four common gut microbiota phyla: actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, firmicutes and proteobacteria. To emphasize the importance of graph embedding in the context of biochemical networks, we illustrate how graph embedding can guide visualization.The code and datasets are available through https://github.com/HassounLab/ELP}",
