	abstract = {The tumor immune microenvironment is a main contributor to cancer progression and a promising therapeutic target for oncology. However, immune microenvironments vary profoundly between patients and biomarkers for prognosis and treatment response lack precision. A comprehensive compendium of tumor immune cells is required to pinpoint predictive cellular states and their spatial localization. We generated a single-cell tumor immune atlas, jointly analyzing \&gt;500,000 cells from 217 patients and 13 cancer types, providing the basis for a patient stratification based on immune cell compositions. Projecting immune cells from external tumors onto the atlas facilitated an automated cell annotation system for a harmonized interpretation. To enable in situ mapping of immune populations for digital pathology, we applied SPOTlight, combining single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data and identifying striking spatial immune cell patterns in tumor sections. We expect the tumor immune cell atlas, together with our versatile toolbox for precision oncology, to advance currently applied stratification approaches for prognosis and immuno-therapy.Competing Interest StatementJS is co-founder of Mosaic Biomedicals, Board member of Northern-Mosaic partnership and has ownership interests from Mosaic Biomedicals and Northern Biologics.

	abstract = {While the development of new drugs is costly, time consuming, and often accompanied with safety issues, drug repurposing, where old drugs with established safety are used for medical conditions other than originally developed, becomes an attractive alternative. Then, how the old drugs work on new targets becomes a crucial part of drug repurposing and gains much of interest. Several statistical and machine learning models have been proposed to estimate drug{\textendash}target binding affinity and deep learning approaches have been shown to be among state-of-the-art methods. However, drugs and targets in these models were commonly represented in 1D strings, regardless the fact that molecules are by nature formed by the chemical bonding of atoms. In this work, we propose GraphDTA to capture the structural information of drugs, possibly enhancing the predictive power of the affinity. In particular, unlike competing methods, drugs are represented as graphs and graph convolutional networks are used to learn drug{\textendash}target binding affinity. We trial our method on two benchmark drug{\textendash}target binding affinity datasets and compare the performance with the state-of-the-art schemes in the field. The results show that our proposed method can not only predict the affinity better than non-deep learning models, but also outperform competing deep learning approaches. This demonstrates the practical advantages of graph-based representation for molecules in providing accurate prediction of drug{\textendash}target binding affinity. The application may also include any recommendation systems where either or both of the user- and product-like sides can be represented in graphs.Availability and implementation The proposed models are implemented in Python. Related data, pre-trained models, and source code are publicly available at https://github.com/thinng/GraphDTA.},

    abstract = "{Neural methods to extract drug-drug interactions (DDIs) from literature require a large number of annotations. In this study, we propose a novel method to effectively utilize external drug database information as well as information from large-scale plain text for DDI extraction. Specifically, we focus on drug description and molecular structure information as the drug database information.We evaluated our approach on the DDIExtraction 2013 shared task data set. We obtained the following results. First, large-scale raw text information can greatly improve the performance of extracting DDIs when combined with the existing model and it shows the state-of-the-art performance. Second, each of drug description and molecular structure information is helpful to further improve the DDI performance for some specific DDI types. Finally, the simultaneous use of the drug description and molecular structure information can significantly improve the performance on all the DDI types. We showed that the plain text, the drug description information, and molecular structure information are complementary and their effective combination are essential for the improvement.https://github.com/tticoin/DESC\_MOL-DDIE}",
