	abstract = {Single-cell technologies are rapidly advancing, allowing us to gauge the heterogeneity and structure of cellular communities, tissues, and full organisms. The correlations between genes and between cells within such systems can reveal patterns of regulatory interactions, physical structure, and temporal progression of cells along biological processes. However, it is generally a challenge to identify and tease apart these mixed signals within the noisy, high-dimensional single-cell data. Here, we show it is possible to detect a signature for lineage in the covariance spectrum of single-cell data, predict how it will change with developmental time, and predict how it can be extended to examine the spatial structure of a tissue.Gene expression profiles of a cellular population, generated by single-cell RNA sequencing, contains rich information about biological state, including cell type, cell cycle phase, gene regulatory patterns, and location within the tissue of origin. A major challenge is to disentangle information about these different biological states from each other, including distinguishing from cell lineage, since the correlation of cellular expression patterns is necessarily contaminated by ancestry. Here, we use a recent advance in random matrix theory, discovered in the context of protein phylogeny, to identify differentiation or ancestry-related processes in single-cell data. Qin and Colwell [C. Qin, L. J. Colwell, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 115, 690{\textendash}695 (2018)] showed that ancestral relationships in protein sequences create a power-law signature in the covariance eigenvalue distribution. We demonstrate the existence of such signatures in scRNA-seq data and that the genes driving them are indeed related to differentiation and developmental pathways. We predict the existence of similar power-law signatures for cells along linear trajectories and demonstrate this for linearly differentiating systems. Furthermore, we generalize to show that the same signatures can arise for cells along tissue-specific spatial trajectories. We illustrate these principles in diverse tissues and organisms, including the mammalian epidermis and lung, Drosophila whole-embryo, adult Hydra, dendritic cells, the intestinal epithelium, and cells undergoing induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) reprogramming. We show how these results can be used to interpret the gradual dynamics of lineage structure along iPSC reprogramming. Together, we provide a framework that can be used to identify signatures of specific biological processes in single-cell data without prior knowledge and identify candidate genes associated with these processes.The single-cell RNA-seq datasets used for the current study were all previously published and can be accessed from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database with the following GEO accession numbers: GSE67602 for the epidermis (34), GSE52583 for the lung (35), GSE95025 for the Drosophila embryo (6), GSE121617 for the Hydra (37), GSE125162 for the yeast colonies (38), GSE122662 for the iPSC reprogramming dataset (36), GSE60783 for the DCs (41), and GSM2644349 and GSM2644350 for the intestinal epithelium (44) and their corresponding zone-reconstruction (42).
