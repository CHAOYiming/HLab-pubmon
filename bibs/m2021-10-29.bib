    abstract = "{Intra-tumor heterogeneity is one of the key confounding factors in deciphering tumor evolution. Malignant cells exhibit variations in their gene expression, copy numbers and mutation even when originating from a single progenitor cell. Single cell sequencing of tumor cells has recently emerged as a viable option for unmasking the underlying tumor heterogeneity. However, extracting features from single cell genomic data in order to infer their evolutionary trajectory remains computationally challenging due to the extremely noisy and sparse nature of the data.Here we describe ‘Dhaka’, a variational autoencoder method which transforms single cell genomic data to a reduced dimension feature space that is more efficient in differentiating between (hidden) tumor subpopulations. Our method is general and can be applied to several different types of genomic data including copy number variation from scDNA-Seq and gene expression from scRNA-Seq experiments. We tested the method on synthetic and six single cell cancer datasets where the number of cells ranges from 250 to 6000 for each sample. Analysis of the resulting feature space revealed subpopulations of cells and their marker genes. The features are also able to infer the lineage and/or differentiation trajectory between cells greatly improving upon prior methods suggested for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction of such data.All the datasets used in the paper are publicly available and developed software package and supporting info is available on Github https://github.com/MicrosoftGenomics/Dhaka.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

	abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have revolutionized biomedical sciences by enabling genome-wide profiling of gene expression levels at an unprecedented single-cell resolution. A distinct characteristic of scRNA-seq data is the vast proportion of zeros unseen in bulk RNA-seq data. Researchers view these zeros differently: some regard zeros as biological signals representing no or low gene expression, while others regard zeros as false signals or missing data to be corrected. As a result, the scRNA-seq field faces much controversy regarding how to handle zeros in data analysis. In this paper, we first discuss the sources of biological and non-biological zeros in scRNA-seq data. Second, we evaluate the impacts of non-biological zeros on cell clustering and differential gene expression analysis. Third, we summarize the advantages, disadvantages, and suitable uses of three input data types: observed counts, imputed counts, and binarized counts. Fourth, we benchmark the performance of the three input data types in cell clustering, dimension reduction, and differential gene expression analysis. Finally, we discuss the open questions regarding non-biological zeros and the importance of transparent analysis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
