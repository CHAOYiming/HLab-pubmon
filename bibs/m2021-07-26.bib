title={Enhanced detection of minimal residual disease by targeted sequencing of phased variants in circulating tumor DNA},
journal={Nature Biotechnology},

month={Jul},
day={22},
abstract={Circulating tumor-derived DNA (ctDNA) is an emerging biomarker for many cancers, but the limited sensitivity of current detection methods reduces its utility for diagnosing minimal residual disease. Here we describe phased variant enrichment and detection sequencing (PhasED-seq), a method that uses multiple somatic mutations in individual DNA fragments to improve the sensitivity of ctDNA detection. Leveraging whole-genome sequences from 2,538 tumors, we identify phased variants and their associations with mutational signatures. We show that even without molecular barcodes, the limits of detection of PhasED-seq outperform prior methods, including duplex barcoding, allowing ctDNA detection in the ppm range in participant samples. We profiled 678 specimens from 213 participants with B cell lymphomas, including serial cell-free DNA samples before and during therapy for diffuse large B cell lymphoma. In participants with undetectable ctDNA after two cycles of therapy using a next-generation sequencing-based approach termed cancer personalized profiling by deep sequencing, an additional 25{\%} have ctDNA detectable by PhasED-seq and have worse outcomes. Finally, we demonstrate the application of PhasED-seq to solid tumors.},

	abstract = {We are pleased to introduce a first-of-its-kind algorithm that combines in-silico region detection and spatial gene-expression imputation. Spatial transcriptomics by 10X Visium (ST) is a new technology used to dissect gene and cell spatial organization. Analyzing this new type of data has two main challenges: automatically annotating the major tissue regions and excessive zero values of gene-expression due to high dropout rates. We developed a computational tool{\textemdash}MIST{\textemdash}that addresses both challenges by automatically identifying tissue regions and estimating missing gene-expression values for individual tissue regions. We validated MIST detected regions across multiple datasets using manual annotation on the histological staining images as references. We also demonstrated that MIST can accurately recover ST{\textquoteright}s missing values through hold-out experiments. Furthermore, we showed that MIST could identify subtle intra-tissue heterogeneity and recover spatial gene-gene interaction signals. We therefore strongly encourage using MIST prior to downstream ST analysis because it provides unbiased region annotations and enables accurately de-noised spatial gene-expression profiles.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Here, we provide an unsupervised approach to study spatial genome integrity in situ to gain molecular insight into clonal relationships. We employed spatially resolved transcriptomics to infer spatial copy number variations in \&gt;120 000 regions across multiple organs, in benign and malignant tissues. We demonstrate that genome-wide copy number variation reveals distinct clonal patterns within tumours and in nearby benign tissue. Our results suggest a model for how genomic instability arises in histologically benign tissue that may represent early events in cancer evolution. We highlight the power of an unsupervised approach to capture the molecular and spatial continuums in a tissue context and challenge the rationale for treatment paradigms, including focal therapy.Competing Interest StatementJL, MH, MJ, RM, LK, AA, LL and JL are scientific consultants to 10x Genomics Inc.},
