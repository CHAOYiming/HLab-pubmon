==========
We read CHISEL paper for single-cell copy number variation calling 
:cite:`zaccaria2020characterizing` in detail today.

==========
We read variational auto-encoder paper :cite:`kingma2013auto` in detail today, 
with brief disucssion on its single cell application scVI :cite:`lopez2018deep`.


2021-05-17
==========
We read three papers: RPCI :cite:`liu2021robust`, Cell-ID: :cite:`cortal2021gene`,
scPred :cite:`alquicira2019scpred`, all about linear projection of single-cell 
transcriptome to lower dimensional space with singular value decomposition (SVD),
the implementation technique for Principal component analysis (PCA).

We also referred more details on PCA and SVD by reading the following book 
chapters:

* SVD quick reading: chapter 2.7-2.8 (4 pages): 
  https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/linear_algebra.html
* SVD Longer reading: chapter 4.5: https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf
* PCA quick reading: chapter 12.1

==========
We read the Chapter 8 Optimisation, PML book 1.
https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html

Rongting lead the reading of the foundation part, Mingze lead the discussion of the specific methods (SGD and the rest), and Chen C 
introduce the EM details.
