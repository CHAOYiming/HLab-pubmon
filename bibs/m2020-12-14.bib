	elocation-id = {2020.12.01.405886},

	doi = {10.1101/2020.12.01.405886},
	publisher = {Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory},
	abstract = {Standard preprocessing of single-cell RNA-seq UMI data includes normalization by sequencing depth to remove this technical variability, and nonlinear transformation to stabilize the variance across genes with different expression levels. Instead, two recent papers propose to use statistical count models for these tasks: Hafemeister and Satija (2019) recommend using Pearson residuals from negative binomial regression, while Townes et al. (2019) recommend fitting a generalized PCA model. Here, we investigate the connection between these approaches theoretically and empirically, and compare their effects on downstream processing. We show that the model of Hafemeister and Satija (2019) produces noisy parameter estimates because it is overspecified (which is why the original paper employs post-hoc regularization). When specified more parsimoniously, it has a simple analytic solution equivalent to the rank-one Poisson GLM-PCA of Townes et al. (2019). Further, our analysis indicates that per-gene overdispersion estimates in Hafemeister and Satija (2019) are biased, and that the data analyzed in that paper are in fact consistent with constant overdispersion parameter across genes. We then use negative control data without biological variability to estimate the technical overdispersion of UMI counts, and find that across several different experimental protocols, the data suggest very moderate overdispersion. Finally, we argue that analytic Pearson residuals (or, equivalently, rank-one GLM-PCA or negative binomial regression after regularization) strongly outperform standard preprocessing for identifying biologically variable genes, and capture more biologically meaningful variation when used for dimensionality reduction, compared to other methods.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	title={nnU-Net: a self-configuring method for deep learning-based biomedical image segmentation},
	journal={Nature Methods},
	year={2020},
	month={Dec},
	day={07},
	abstract={Biomedical imaging is a driver of scientific discovery and a core component of medical care and is being stimulated by the field of deep learning. While semantic segmentation algorithms enable image analysis and quantification in many applications, the design of respective specialized solutions is non-trivial and highly dependent on dataset properties and hardware conditions. We developed nnU-Net, a deep learning-based segmentation method that automatically configures itself, including preprocessing, network architecture, training and post-processing for any new task. The key design choices in this process are modeled as a set of fixed parameters, interdependent rules and empirical decisions. Without manual intervention, nnU-Net surpasses most existing approaches, including highly specialized solutions on 23 public datasets used in international biomedical segmentation competitions. We make nnU-Net publicly available as an out-of-the-box tool, rendering state-of-the-art segmentation accessible to a broad audience by requiring neither expert knowledge nor computing resources beyond standard network training.},
