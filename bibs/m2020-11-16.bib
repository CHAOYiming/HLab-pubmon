    abstract = "{Incorporating the temporal dimension into multimorbidity studies has shown to be crucial for achieving a better understanding of the disease associations. Furthermore, due to the multifactorial nature of human disease, exploring disease associations from different perspectives can provide a holistic view to support the study of their etiology.In this work, a temporal systems-medicine approach is proposed for identifying time-dependent multimorbidity patterns from patient disease trajectories, by integrating data from electronic health records with genetic and phenotypic information. Specifically, the disease trajectories are clustered using an unsupervised algorithm based on dynamic time warping and three disease similarity metrics: clinical, genetic and phenotypic. An evaluation method is also presented for quantitatively assessing, in the different disease spaces, both the cluster homogeneity and the respective similarities between the associated diseases within individual trajectories. The latter can facilitate exploring the origin(s) in the identified disease patterns. The proposed integrative methodology can be applied to any longitudinal cohort and disease of interest. In this paper, prostate cancer is selected as a use case of medical interest to demonstrate, for the first time, the identification of temporal disease multimorbidities in different disease spaces.https://gitlab.com/agiannoula/diseasetrajectoriesSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

    abstract = "{Complex data structures composed of different groups of observations and blocks of variables are increasingly collected in many domains, including metabolomics. Analysing these high-dimensional data constitutes a challenge, and the objective of this article is to present an original multivariate method capable of explicitly taking into account links between data tables when they involve the same observations and/or variables. For that purpose, an extension of standard principal component analysis called NetPCA was developed.The proposed algorithm was illustrated as an efficient solution for addressing complex multigroup and multiblock datasets. A case study involving the analysis of metabolomic data with different annotation levels and originating from a chronic kidney disease (CKD) study was used to highlight the different aspects and the additional outputs of the method compared to standard PCA. On the one hand, the model parameters allowed an efficient evaluation of each group’s influence to be performed. On the other hand, the relative relevance of each block of variables to the model provided decisive information for an objective interpretation of the different metabolic annotation levels.NetPCA is available as a Python package with NumPy dependencies.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",
