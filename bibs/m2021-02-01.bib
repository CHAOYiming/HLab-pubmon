	abstract = {Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled the unbiased, high-throughput quantification of gene expression specific to cell types and states. With the cost of scRNA-seq decreasing and techniques for sample multiplexing improving, population-scale scRNA-seq, and thus single-cell expression quantitative trait locus (sc-eQTL) mapping, is increasingly feasible. Mapping of sc-eQTL provides additional resolution to study the regulatory role of common genetic variants on gene expression across a plethora of cell types and states, and promises to improve our understanding of genetic regulation across tissues in both health and disease. While previously established methods for bulk eQTL mapping can, in principle, be applied to sc-eQTL mapping, there are a number of open questions about how best to process scRNA-seq data and adapt bulk methods to optimise sc-eQTL mapping. Here, we evaluate the role of different normalisation and aggregation strategies, covariate adjustment techniques, and multiple testing correction methods to establish best practice guidelines. We use both real and simulated datasets across single-cell technologies to systematically assess the impact of these different statistical approaches and provide recommendations for future single-cell eQTL studies that can yield up to twice as many eQTL discoveries as default approaches ported from bulk studies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

    abstract = "{Identifying cancer driver genes is a key task in cancer informatics. Most existing methods are focused on individual cancer drivers which regulate biological processes leading to cancer. However, the effect of a single gene may not be sufficient to drive cancer progression. Here, we hypothesize that there are driver gene groups that work in concert to regulate cancer, and we develop a novel computational method to detect those driver gene groups.We develop a novel method named DriverGroup to detect driver gene groups by using gene expression and gene interaction data. The proposed method has three stages: (i) constructing the gene network, (ii) discovering critical nodes of the constructed network and (iii) identifying driver gene groups based on the discovered critical nodes. Before evaluating the performance of DriverGroup in detecting cancer driver groups, we firstly assess its performance in detecting the influence of gene groups, a key step of DriverGroup. The application of DriverGroup to DREAM4 data demonstrates that it is more effective than other methods in detecting the regulation of gene groups. We then apply DriverGroup to the BRCA dataset to identify driver groups for breast cancer. The identified driver groups are promising as several group members are confirmed to be related to cancer in literature. We further use the predicted driver groups in survival analysis and the results show that the survival curves of patient subpopulations classified using the predicted driver groups are significantly differentiated, indicating the usefulness of DriverGroup.DriverGroup is available at https://github.com/pvvhoang/DriverGroupSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

	abstract = {The biological processes from genotype to phenotype are complex involving multi-scale mechanisms. Increasing multi-modal data enables a deeper understanding of underlying complex mechanisms in various phenotypes. However, integrating and interpreting such large-scale multi-modal data remains challenging, especially given highly heterogeneous, nonlinear relationships across modalities. To address this, we developed an interpretable regularized learning model, deepManReg to predict phenotypes from multi-modal data. First, deepManReg employs deep neural networks to learn cross-modal manifolds and then align multi-modal features onto a common latent space. This space aims to preserve both global consistency and local smoothness across modalities and to reveal higher-order nonlinear cross-modal relationships. Second, deepManReg uses cross-modal manifolds as a feature graph to regularize the classifiers for improving phenotype predictions and also prioritizing the multi-modal features and cross-modal interactions for the phenotypes. We applied deepManReg to recent single-cell multi-modal data such as Patch-seq data including transcriptomics and electrophysiology for neuronal cells in the mouse brain. We show that deepManReg significantly improves predicting cellular phenotypes and also prioritizing genes and electrophysiological features for the phenotypes. Finally, deepManReg is open-source and general for phenotype prediction from multi-modal dataCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Motivation: The negative binomial distribution has been shown to be a good model for counts data from both bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). Gaussian process (GP) regression provides a useful non-parametric approach for modeling temporal or spatial changes in gene expression. However, currently available GP regression methods that implement negative binomial likelihood models do not scale to the increasingly large datasets being produced by single-cell and spatial transcriptomics. Results: The GPcounts package implements GP regression methods for modelling counts data using a negative binomial likelihood function. Computational efficiency is achieved through the use of variational Bayesian inference. The GP function models changes in the mean of the negative binomial likelihood through a logarithmic link function and the dispersion parameter is fitted by maximum likelihood. We validate the method on simulated time course data, showing that it is better able to identify changes in over-dispersed counts data than methods based on Gaussian or Poisson likelihoods. To demonstrate temporal inference, we apply GPcounts to single-cell RNA-seq datasets after pseudotime and branching inference. To demonstrate spatial inference, we apply GPcounts to data from the mouse olfactory bulb to identify spatially variable genes and compare to two published GP methods. We also provide the option of modelling additional dropout using a zero-inflated negative binomial. Our results show that GPcounts can be used to model temporal and spatial counts data in cases where simpler Gaussian and Poisson likelihoods are unrealistic. Availability: GPcounts is implemented using the GPflow library in Python and is available at https://github.com/ManchesterBioinference/GPcounts along with the data, code and notebooks required to reproduce the results presented here.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

However, it is difficult to benchmark the performance of various scATAC-seq analysis techniques (such as clustering and deconvolution) without having a priori a known set of gold-standard cell types. To simulate scATAC-seq experiments with known cell-type labels, we introduce an efficient and scalable scATAC-seq simulation method (SCAN-ATAC-Sim) that down-samples bulk ATAC-seq data (e.g., from representative cell lines or tissues). Our protocol uses a consistent but tunable signal-to-noise ratio across cell types in a scATAC-seq simulation for integrating bulk experiments with different levels of background noise, and it independently samples twice without replacement to account for the diploid genome. Because it uses an efficient weighted reservoir sampling algorithm and is highly parallelizable with OpenMP, our implementation in C ++ allows millions of cells to be simulated in less than an hour on a laptop computer.SCAN-ATAC-Sim is available at scan-atac-sim.gersteinlab.org.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",
