abstract={Spatial transcriptomic technologies promise to resolve cellular wiring diagrams of tissues in health and disease, but comprehensive mapping of cell types in situ remains a challenge. Here we present сell2location, a Bayesian model that can resolve fine-grained cell types in spatial transcriptomic data and create comprehensive cellular maps of diverse tissues. Cell2location accounts for technical sources of variation and borrows statistical strength across locations, thereby enabling the integration of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics with higher sensitivity and resolution than existing tools. We assessed cell2location in three different tissues and show improved mapping of fine-grained cell types. In the mouse brain, we discovered fine regional astrocyte subtypes across the thalamus and hypothalamus. In the human lymph node, we spatially mapped a rare pre-germinal center B cell population. In the human gut, we resolved fine immune cell populations in lymphoid follicles. Collectively, our results present сell2location as a versatile analysis tool for mapping tissue architectures in a comprehensive manner.},

title={Identifying temporal and spatial patterns of variation from multimodal data using MEFISTO},
journal={Nature Methods},

day={13},
abstract={Factor analysis is a widely used method for dimensionality reduction in genome biology, with applications from personalized health to single-cell biology. Existing factor analysis models assume independence of the observed samples, an assumption that fails in spatio-temporal profiling studies. Here we present MEFISTO, a flexible and versatile toolbox for modeling high-dimensional data when spatial or temporal dependencies between the samples are known. MEFISTO maintains the established benefits of factor analysis for multimodal data, but enables the performance of spatio-temporally informed dimensionality reduction, interpolation, and separation of smooth from non-smooth patterns of variation. Moreover, MEFISTO can integrate multiple related datasets by simultaneously identifying and aligning the underlying patterns of variation in a data-driven manner. To illustrate MEFISTO, we apply the model to different datasets with spatial or temporal resolution, including an evolutionary atlas of organ development, a longitudinal microbiome study, a single-cell multi-omics atlas of mouse gastrulation and spatially resolved transcriptomics.},

title={CellRank for directed single-cell fate mapping},
journal={Nature Methods},
year={2022},
month={Jan},
day={13},
abstract={Computational trajectory inference enables the reconstruction of cell state dynamics from single-cell RNA sequencing experiments. However, trajectory inference requires that the direction of a biological process is known, largely limiting its application to differentiating systems in normal development. Here, we present CellRank (https://cellrank.org) for single-cell fate mapping in diverse scenarios, including regeneration, reprogramming and disease, for which direction is unknown. Our approach combines the robustness of trajectory inference with directional information from RNA velocity, taking into account the gradual and stochastic nature of cellular fate decisions, as well as uncertainty in velocity vectors. On pancreas development data, CellRank automatically detects initial, intermediate and terminal populations, predicts fate potentials and visualizes continuous gene expression trends along individual lineages. Applied to lineage-traced cellular reprogramming data, predicted fate probabilities correctly recover reprogramming outcomes. CellRank also predicts a new dedifferentiation trajectory during postinjury lung regeneration, including previously unknown intermediate cell states, which we confirm experimentally.},

    year = {2021},
    month = {12},
    abstract = "{Kernel-based association test (KAT) has been a popular approach to evaluate the association of expressions of a gene set (e.g. pathway) with a phenotypic trait. KATs rely on kernel functions which capture the sample similarity across multiple features, to capture potential linear or non-linear relationship among features in a gene set. When calculating the kernel functions, no network graphical information about the features is considered. While genes in a functional group (e.g. a pathway) are not independent in general due to regulatory interactions, incorporating regulatory network (or graph) information can potentially increase the power of KAT. In this work, we propose a graph-embedded kernel association test, termed gKAT. gKAT incorporates prior pathway knowledge when constructing a kernel function into hypothesis testing.We apply a diffusion kernel to capture any graph structures in a gene set, then incorporate such information to build a kernel function for further association test. We illustrate the geometric meaning of the approach. Through extensive simulation studies, we show that the proposed gKAT algorithm can improve testing power compared to the one without considering graph structures. Application to a real dataset further demonstrate the utility of the method.The R code used for the analysis can be accessed at https://github.com/JialinQu/gKAT.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

    title = "{Inferring gene regulatory network via fusing gene expression image and RNA-seq data}",
    journal = {Bioinformatics},
    year = {2022},
    month = {01},
    abstract = "{Recently, with the development of high-throughput experimental technology, reconstruction of gene regulatory network (GRN) has ushered in new opportunities and challenges. Some previous methods mainly extract gene expression information based on RNA-seq data, but the associated information is very limited. With the establishment of gene expression image database, it is possible to infer GRN from image data with rich spatial information.Firstly, we propose a new convolutional neural network (called SDINet), which can extract gene expression information from images and identify the interaction between genes. SDINet can obtain the detailed information and high-level semantic information from the images well. And it can achieve satisfying performance on image data(Acc: 0.7196, F1: 0.7374). Secondly, we apply the idea of our SDINet to build an RNA-model, which also achieves good results on RNA-seq data(Acc: 0.8962, F1: 0.8950). Finally, we combine image data and RNA-seq data, and design a new fusion network to explore the potential relationship between them. Experiments show that our proposed network fusing two modalities can obtain satisfying performance(Acc: 0.9116, F1: 0.9118) than any single data.We propose a new network that can better extract gene expression information from image data. Besides, we combine image data and RNA-seq data to infer GRN and design a new fusion network to learn the joint features of these two data types for the first time.Data and code are available from https://github.com/guofei-tju/Combine-Gene-Expression-images-and-RNA-seq-data-For-infering-GRN.}",

	abstract = {Spatial transcriptomics is now a mature technology, allowing to assay gene expression changes in the histological context of complex tissues. A canonical analysis workflow starts with the identification of tissue zones that share similar expression profiles, followed by the detection of highly variable or spatially variable genes. Rapid increases in the scale and complexity of spatial transcriptomic datasets demand that these analysis steps are conducted in a consistent and integrated manner, a requirement that is not met by current methods. To address this, we here present SpatialDE2, which unifies the mapping of tissue zones and spatial variable gene detection as integrated software framework, while at the same time advancing current algorithms for both of these steps. Formulated in a Bayesian framework, the model accounts for the Poisson count noise, while simultaneously offering superior computational speed compared to previous methods. We validate SpatialDE2 using simulated data and illustrate its utility in the context of two real-world applications to the spatial transcriptomics profiles of the mouse brain and human endometrium.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
