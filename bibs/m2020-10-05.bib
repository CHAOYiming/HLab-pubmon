    abstract = "{In recent years, the well-known Infinite Sites Assumption (ISA) has been a fundamental feature of computational methods devised for reconstructing tumor phylogenies and inferring cancer progressions. However, recent studies leveraging Single-Cell Sequencing (SCS) techniques have shown evidence of the widespread recurrence and, especially, loss of mutations in several tumor samples. While there exist established computational methods that infer phylogenies with mutation losses, there remain some advancements to be made.We present SASC (Simulated Annealing Single-Cell inference): a new and robust approach based on simulated annealing for the inference of cancer progression from SCS data sets. In particular, we introduce an extension of the model of evolution where mutations are only accumulated, by allowing also a limited amount of mutation loss in the evolutionary history of the tumor: the Dollo-k model. We demonstrate that SASC achieves high levels of accuracy when tested on both simulated and real data sets and in comparison with some other available methods.The Simulated Annealing Single-Cell inference (SASC) tool is open source and available at https://github.com/sciccolella/sasc.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

	abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is developing rapidly, and investigators seeking to use this technology are left with a variety of options for both experimental platform and bioinformatics methods. There is an urgent need for scRNA-seq reference datasets for benchmarking of different scRNA-seq platforms and bioinformatics methods. To be broadly applicable, these should be generated from renewable, well characterized reference samples and processed in multiple centers across different platforms. Here we present a benchmarking scRNA-seq dataset that includes 20 scRNA-seq datasets acquired either as a mixtures or as individual samples from two biologically distinct cell lines for which a large amount of multi-platform whole genome sequencing data are also available. These scRNA-seq datasets were generated from multiple popular platforms across four sequencing centers. Our benchmark datasets provide a resource that we believe will have great value for the single-cell community by serving as a reference dataset for evaluating various bioinformatics methods for scRNA-seq analyses, including but not limited to data preprocessing, imputation, normalization, clustering, batch correction, and differential analysis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
