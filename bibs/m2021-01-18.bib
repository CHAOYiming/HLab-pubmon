    abstract = "{Clustering techniques are widely used in the analysis of large datasets to group together samples with similar properties. For example, clustering is often used in the field of single-cell RNA-sequencing in order to identify different cell types present in a tissue sample. There are many algorithms for performing clustering, and the results can vary substantially. In particular, the number of groups present in a dataset is often unknown, and the number of clusters identified by an algorithm can change based on the parameters used. To explore and examine the impact of varying clustering resolution, we present clustering trees. This visualization shows the relationships between clusters at multiple resolutions, allowing researchers to see how samples move as the number of clusters increases. In addition, meta-information can be overlaid on the tree to inform the choice of resolution and guide in identification of clusters. We illustrate the features of clustering trees using a series of simulations as well as two real examples, the classical iris dataset and a complex single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset. Clustering trees can be produced using the clustree R package, available from CRAN and developed on GitHub.}",

  ABSTRACT={Currently most methods take manual strategies to annotate cell types after clustering the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Such methods are labor-intensive and heavily rely on user expertise, which may lead to inconsistent results. We present SCSA, an automatic tool to annotate cell types from scRNA-seq data, based on a score annotation model combining differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and confidence levels of cell markers from both known and user-defined information. Evaluation on real scRNA-seq datasets from different sources with other methods shows that SCSA is able to assign the cells into the correct types at a fully automated mode with a desirable precision.}
