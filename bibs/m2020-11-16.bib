    abstract = "{Incorporating the temporal dimension into multimorbidity studies has shown to be crucial for achieving a better understanding of the disease associations. Furthermore, due to the multifactorial nature of human disease, exploring disease associations from different perspectives can provide a holistic view to support the study of their etiology.In this work, a temporal systems-medicine approach is proposed for identifying time-dependent multimorbidity patterns from patient disease trajectories, by integrating data from electronic health records with genetic and phenotypic information. Specifically, the disease trajectories are clustered using an unsupervised algorithm based on dynamic time warping and three disease similarity metrics: clinical, genetic and phenotypic. An evaluation method is also presented for quantitatively assessing, in the different disease spaces, both the cluster homogeneity and the respective similarities between the associated diseases within individual trajectories. The latter can facilitate exploring the origin(s) in the identified disease patterns. The proposed integrative methodology can be applied to any longitudinal cohort and disease of interest. In this paper, prostate cancer is selected as a use case of medical interest to demonstrate, for the first time, the identification of temporal disease multimorbidities in different disease spaces.https://gitlab.com/agiannoula/diseasetrajectoriesSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

    abstract = "{Complex data structures composed of different groups of observations and blocks of variables are increasingly collected in many domains, including metabolomics. Analysing these high-dimensional data constitutes a challenge, and the objective of this article is to present an original multivariate method capable of explicitly taking into account links between data tables when they involve the same observations and/or variables. For that purpose, an extension of standard principal component analysis called NetPCA was developed.The proposed algorithm was illustrated as an efficient solution for addressing complex multigroup and multiblock datasets. A case study involving the analysis of metabolomic data with different annotation levels and originating from a chronic kidney disease (CKD) study was used to highlight the different aspects and the additional outputs of the method compared to standard PCA. On the one hand, the model parameters allowed an efficient evaluation of each group’s influence to be performed. On the other hand, the relative relevance of each block of variables to the model provided decisive information for an objective interpretation of the different metabolic annotation levels.NetPCA is available as a Python package with NumPy dependencies.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

Here, we set out to generate single-cell atlases of both gene expression (this study) and chromatin accessibility (Domcke et al., this issue) using diverse human tissues obtained during midgestation.RATIONALEContemporary knowledge of the molecular basis of in vivo human development mostly derives from a combination of human genetics, in vivo investigations of model organisms, and in vitro studies of differentiating human cell lines, rather than through direct investigations of developing human tissues. Several challenges have historically limited the study of developing human tissues at the molecular level, including limited access, tissue degradation, and cell type heterogeneity. For this and the companion study (Domcke et al., this issue), we were able to overcome these challenges.RESULTSWe applied three-level single-cell combinatorial indexing for gene expression (sci-RNA-seq3) to 121 human fetal samples ranging from 72 to 129 days in estimated postconceptual age and representing 15 organs, altogether profiling 4 million single cells. We developed and applied a framework for quantifying cell type specificity, identifying 657 cell subtypes, which we preliminarily annotated based on cross-matching to mouse cell atlases. We identified and validated potentially circulating trophoblast-like and hepatoblast-like cells in unexpected tissues. Profiling gene expression in diverse tissues facilitated the cross-tissue analyses of broadly distributed cell types, including blood, endothelial, and epithelial cells. For blood cells, this yielded a multiorgan map of cell state trajectories from hematopoietic stem cells to all major sublineages. Multiple lines of evidence support the adrenal gland as a normal, albeit minor, site of erythropoiesis during fetal development. It was notably straightforward to integrate these human fetal data with a mouse embryonic cell atlas, despite differences in species and developmental stage. For some systems, this essentially permitted us to bridge gene expression dynamics from the embryonic to the fetal stages of mammalian development.CONCLUSIONThe single-cell data resource presented here is notable for its scale, its focus on human fetal development, the breadth of tissues analyzed, and the parallel generation of gene expression (this study) and chromatin accessibility data (Domcke et al., this issue). We furthermore consolidate the technical framework for individual laboratories to generate and analyze gene expression and chromatin accessibility data from millions of single cells. Looking forward, we envision that the somewhat narrow window of midgestational human development studied here will be complemented by additional atlases of earlier and later time points, as well as similarly comprehensive profiling and integration of data from model organisms. The continued development and application of methods for ascertaining gene expression and chromatin accessibility{\textemdash}in concert with spatial, epigenetic, proteomic, lineage history, and other information{\textemdash}will be necessary to obtain a comprehensive view of the temporal unfolding of human cell type diversity that begins at the single-cell zygote.

Together, these analyses generate comprehensive atlases of early human development.Science, this issue p. eaba7721, p. eaba7612INTRODUCTIONIn recent years, the single-cell genomics field has made incredible progress toward disentangling the cellular heterogeneity of human tissues. However, the overwhelming majority of effort has been focused on single-cell gene expression rather than the chromatin landscape that shapes and is shaped by gene expression. Toward advancing our understanding of the regulatory programs that underlie human cell types, we set out to generate single-cell atlases of both chromatin accessibility (this study) and gene expression (Cao et al., this issue) from a broad range of human fetal tissues.RATIONALERegions of accessible chromatin in our genome, such as enhancers, play key roles in the determination and maintenance of cell fates. Accessible regions are also markedly enriched for genetic variation that contributes to common disease heritability. The vast majority of chromatin accessibility data collected to date lacks single-cell resolution, limiting our ability to infer patterns such as which cell types are most relevant to each common disease. We previously demonstrated single-cell profiling of chromatin accessibility using combinatorial indexing, based on two rounds of in situ molecular barcoding. Here, we describe an improved assay that uses three levels of combinatorial indexing and does not rely on custom reagents. The method, sci-ATAC-seq3, reduces costs and opens the door to the scales necessary for generating a human cell atlas of chromatin accessibility.RESULTSWe applied sci-ATAC-seq3 to 59 human fetal samples ranging from 89 to 125 days in estimated postconceptual age and representing 15 organs, altogether obtaining high-quality chromatin accessibility profiles from ~800,000 single cells. Gene expression data collected on an overlapping set of tissues were leveraged to annotate cell types. We asked which transcription factor (TF) motifs found in the accessible sites of each cell best explain its cell type affiliation, revealing both known and potentially previously unknown regulators of cell fate specification and/or maintenance. Many TFs could be putatively assigned as activators or repressors depending on whether their expression and the accessibility of their cognate motif were positively or negatively correlated across cell types. Comparing chromatin accessibility from cell types that appear in multiple tissues revealed that whereas blood cell types are highly similar across organs, endothelial cells exhibit organ-specific chromatin accessibility, which appears to be controlled combinatorially by several TFs with overlapping expression patterns. We leveraged our master set of 1.05 million accessible sites, spanning 532 Mb or 17\% of the reference human genome, to score cell type{\textendash}specific links between candidate enhancers and genes based on coaccessibility, to detect cell type{\textendash}specific enrichment of heritability for specific common human diseases, and to identify genetic variants affecting chromatin accessibility in cis. Comparisons with chromatin accessibility in corresponding adult tissues allowed us to identify fetal-specific cell subtypes and nominate POU2F1 as a potential regulator of excitatory neuron development.CONCLUSIONSci-ATAC-seq3 adds to a growing repertoire of single-cell methods that use combinatorial indexing, a technical paradigm whose advantages include exponential scaling and greater range to profile diverse aspects of single-cell biology. We anticipate that the intersection of single-cell chromatin accessibility and gene expression will critically accelerate the field{\textquoteright}s long-term goal of establishing a deep, predictive understanding of gene regulation. An interactive website facilitates the exploration of these freely available data by tissue, cell type, locus, or motif (descartes.brotmanbaty.org).A human cell atlas of fetal chromatin accessibility enables the exploration of in vivo gene regulation across diverse cell types.We devised a three-level combinatorial indexing assay (sci-ATAC-seq3) and profiled chromatin accessibility in ~800,000 single cells from 15 fetal organs. This rich resource enables, for example, identification of cell type{\textendash}specific regulatory elements and TFs, classification of TFs into activators and repressors, and quantification of cell type{\textendash}specific enrichments of complex trait heritability, as well as chromatin accessibility dynamics.The chromatin landscape underlying the specification of human cell types is of fundamental interest. We generated human cell atlases of chromatin accessibility and gene expression in fetal tissues. For chromatin accessibility, we devised a three-level combinatorial indexing assay and applied it to 53 samples representing 15 organs, profiling ~800,000 single cells. We leveraged cell types defined by gene expression to annotate these data and cataloged hundreds of thousands of candidate regulatory elements that exhibit cell type{\textendash}specific chromatin accessibility. We investigated the properties of lineage-specific transcription factors (such as POU2F1 in neurons), organ-specific specializations of broadly distributed cell types (such as blood and endothelial), and cell type{\textendash}specific enrichments of complex trait heritability. These data represent a rich resource for the exploration of in vivo human gene regulation in diverse tissues and cell types.},

    abstract = "{Accurate prediction of gene regulatory rules is important towards understanding of cellular processes. Existing computational algorithms devised for bulk transcriptomics typically require a large number of time points to infer gene regulatory networks (GRNs), are applicable for a small number of genes and fail to detect potential causal relationships effectively. Here, we propose a novel approach ‘TENET’ to reconstruct GRNs from single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) datasets. Employing transfer entropy (TE) to measure the amount of causal relationships between genes, TENET predicts large-scale gene regulatory cascades/relationships from scRNAseq data. TENET showed better performance than other GRN reconstructors, in identifying key regulators from public datasets. Specifically from scRNAseq, TENET identified key transcriptional factors in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and during direct cardiomyocytes reprogramming, where other predictors failed. We further demonstrate that known target genes have significantly higher TE values, and TENET predicted higher TE genes were more influenced by the perturbation of their regulator. Using TENET, we identified and validated that Nme2 is a culture condition specific stem cell factor. These results indicate that TENET is uniquely capable of identifying key regulators from scRNAseq data.}",
