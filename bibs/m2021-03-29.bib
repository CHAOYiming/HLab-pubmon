  abstract = 	 {Many applications, such as text modelling, high-throughput sequencing, and recommender systems, require analysing sparse, high-dimensional, and overdispersed discrete (count or binary) data. Recent deep probabilistic models based on variational autoencoders (VAE) have shown promising results on discrete data but may have inferior modelling performance due to the insufficient capability in modelling overdispersion and model misspecification. To address these issues, we develop a VAE-based framework using the negative binomial distribution as the data distribution. We also provide an analysis of its properties vis-Ã -vis other models. We conduct extensive experiments on three problems from discrete data analysis: text analysis/topic modelling, collaborative filtering, and multi-label learning. Our models outperform state-of-the-art approaches on these problems, while also capturing the phenomenon of overdispersion more effectively.}

	abstract = {Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses typically begin by clustering a gene-by-cell expression matrix to empirically define groups of cells with similar expression profiles. We describe new methods and a new open source library, minicore, for efficient k-means++ center finding and k-means clustering of scRNA-seq data. Minicore works with sparse count data, as it emerges from typical scRNA-seq experiments, as well as with dense data from after dimensionality reduction. Minicore{\textquoteright}s novel vectorized weighted reservoir sampling algorithm allows it to find initial k-means++ centers for a 4-million cell dataset in 1.5 minutes using 20 threads. Minicore can cluster using Euclidean distance, but also supports a wider class of measures like Jensen-Shannon Divergence, Kullback-Leibler Divergence, and the Bhattacharyya distance, which can be directly applied to count data and probability distributions.Further, minicore produces lower-cost centerings more efficiently than scikit-learn for scRNA-seq datasets with millions of cells. With careful handling of priors, minicore implements these distance measures with only minor (\&lt;2-fold) speed differences among all distances. We show that a minicore pipeline consisting of k-means++, localsearch++ and minibatch k-means can cluster a 4-million cell dataset in minutes, using less than 10GiB of RAM. This memory-efficiency enables atlas-scale clustering on laptops and other commodity hardware. Finally, we report findings on which distance measures give clusterings that are most consistent with known cell type labels.Availability The open source library is at https://github.com/dnbaker/minicore.

	abstract = {Background Facing the diversity of omic data and the difficulty of selecting one result over all those produced by several methods, consensus strategies have the potential to reconcile multiple inputs and to produce robust results.Results Here, we introduce ClustOmics, a generic consensus clustering tool that we use in the context of cancer subtyping. ClustOmics relies on a non-relational graph database, which allows for the simultaneous integration of both multiple omic data and results from various clustering methods. This new tool conciliates input clusterings, regardless of their origin, their number, their size or their shape. ClustOmics implements an intuitive and flexible strategy, based upon the idea of evidence accumulation clustering. It computes co-occurrences of pairs of samples in input clusters and uses this score as a similarity measure to reorganise data into consensus clusters.Conclusion We applied ClustOmics to multi-omic disease subtyping on real TCGA cancer data from ten different cancer types. We showed that ClustOmics is robust to heterogeneous qualities of input partitions, smoothing and reconciling preliminary predictions into high quality consensus clusters, both from a computational and a biological point of view. The comparison to a state-of-the-art consensus based integration tool, COCA, further corroborated this statement. However, the main interest of ClustOmics is not to compete with other tools, but rather to make profit from their various predictions when no gold-standard metric is available to assess their significance.Availability ClustOmics{\textquoteright} source code, released under MIT licence, as well as the results obtained on TCGA cancer data are available on Github: https://github.com/galadrielbriere/ClustOmics.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.AbbreviationsAMLAcute Myeloid LeukemiaARIAdjusted Rand IndexBICBreast Invasive CarcinomaCALGBCancer and Leukemia Group BCOADColon AdenocarcinomaEACEvidence Accumulation ClusteringEREstrogen ReceptorFABFrench-American-British (morphology code)FDRFalse Discovery RateGBMGlioblastomaKIRCKidney Renal Clear Cell CarcinomaLCDLouvain Community DetectionLIHCLiver Hepatocellular CarcinomaLUSCLung Squamous Cell CarcinomaMCLMarkov ClusteringMtoMMulti-to-Multi (integration scenario)MQModularization QualityOVOvarian CarcinomaPRProgesterone ReceptorSARCSarcomaSKCMSkin Cutaneous MelanomaStoMSingle-to-Multi (integration scenario)TCGAThe Cancer Genome AtlaswMQweighted Modularization Quality},

	abstract = {Recent technological developments allow us to measure the status of dozens of proteins in individual cells. This opens the way to understand the heterogeneity of complex multi-signaling networks across cells and cell-types, with important implications to understand and treat diseases such as cancer. These technologies are however limited to proteins for which antibodies are available and are fairly costly, making predictions of new markers and of existing markers under new conditions a valuable alternative. To assess our capacity to make such predictions and boost further methodological development, we organised the Single Cell Signaling in Breast Cancer DREAM challenge. We used a mass cytometry data set, covering 36 markers in over 4,000 conditions totalling 80 million single cells across 67 breast cancer cell lines. Through four increasingly difficult subchallenges, the participants predicted missing markers, new conditions, and the time course response of single cells to stimuli in the presence and absence of kinase inhibitors. The challenge results show that despite the stochastic nature of signal transduction in single cells, the signaling events are tightly controlled and machine learning methods can accurately predict new experimental data.Key pointsOver 80 million single-cell multiplexed measurements across 67 cell lines, 54 conditions and 10 time points to benchmark predictive models of single cell signaling73 approaches from 27 teams for predicting response to kinase inhibitors on single cell level, and dynamic response from unperturbed basal omics dataPredictions of single marker models correlate with measurements with a correlation coefficient of 0.76Top models of whole signaling response models perform almost as well as a biological replicateCell-line specific variation in dynamics can be predicted from basal omicsCompeting Interest StatementJSR has received funding from GSK and Sanofi and expects consultant fees from Travere Therapeutics.},
