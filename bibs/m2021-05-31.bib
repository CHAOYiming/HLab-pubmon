	abstract = {Automated cell type annotation of single-cell RNA-seq data has the potential to significantly improve and streamline single cell data analysis, facilitating comparisons and meta-analyses. However, many of the current state-of-the-art techniques suffer from limitations, such as reliance on a single reference dataset or marker gene set, or excessive run times for large datasets. Acquiring high-quality labeled data to use as a reference can be challenging. With CITE-seq, surface protein expression of cells can be directly measured in addition to the RNA expression, facilitating cell type annotation. Here, we compiled and annotated a collection of 16 publicly available CITE-seq datasets. This data was then used as training data to develop Superscan, a supervised machine learning-based prediction model. Using our 16 reference datasets, we benchmarked Superscan and showed that it performs better in terms of both accuracy and speed when compared to other state-of-the-art cell annotation methods. Superscan is pre-trained on a collection of primarily PBMC immune datasets; however, additional data and cell types can be easily added to the training data for further improvement. Finally, we used Superscan to reanalyze a previously published dataset, demonstrating its applicability even when the dataset includes cell types that are missing from the training set.Competing Interest StatementR.G. has received consulting income from Illumina and declares ownership in Ozette Technologies and minor stock ownerships in 10X Genomics.},

	abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revealed an unprecedented degree of immune cell diversity. However, consistent definition of cell subtypes and cell states across studies and diseases remains a major challenge. Here we generate reference T cell atlases for cancer and viral infection by multi-study integration, and develop ProjecTILs, an algorithm for reference atlas projection. In contrast to other methods, ProjecTILs allows not only accurate embedding of new scRNA-seq data into a reference without altering its structure, but also characterizing previously unknown cell states that “deviate” from the reference. ProjecTILs accurately predicts the effects of cell perturbations and identifies gene programs that are altered in different conditions and tissues. A meta-analysis of tumor-infiltrating T cells from several cohorts reveals a strong conservation of T cell subtypes between human and mouse, providing a consistent basis to describe T cell heterogeneity across studies, diseases, and species.},
