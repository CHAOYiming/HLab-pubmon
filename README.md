# HLab-pubmon
Publication monitoring at Huang Lab


## How to use
1. Pick a few journals that you are interested in and found papers that can be
   interesting to any of us in the lab.
2. Keep them in [bib format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX), which you can
   get easily from Google scholar -> cite -> BibTex
3. Modify the .bib file for our meeting, e.g., [bibs/m2020-09-07.bib](https://github.com/StatBiomed/HLab-pubmon/tree/master/bibs/m2020-09-07.bib).
4. Possibly add it to the [docs/Pub2020-21.rst](https://github.com/StatBiomed/HLab-pubmon/tree/master/docs/Pub2020-21.rst) if no one has done.
5. Done, hopefully readthedocs will build automatically.

**Note:** Please pull before your commit, as other people may edit it in the same
time. You may consider edit the bib file on web directly.
